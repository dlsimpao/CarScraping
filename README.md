# CarScraping
I scrape websites of major car companies for educational and non-commercial use.

# Packages Used
- rvest
- RSelenium
- tidyverse

# Websites scraped
- https://www.toyota.com/search-inventory/  
- https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles

# Current plans
1. Allow users to compare two or more cars on the same page.
2. Include cars from other companies

# Disclaimer
My program works specifically for my zip code in the United States. Invariably, there are other discrepancies between the websites I visit and yours, especially with location and time differences. The companies may decide to retouch their websites for example. Please use this as a guide to learn rather than expect that it will work in all cases.
